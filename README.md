**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

My main issue in the projects was to comprehend the concepts of developing effective systems and putting them into practice using coding. I learned during the process that, depending on the needs of the application, there are numerous ways to design algorithms, such as employing hash tables or binary search trees. Each of these methods has a unique mix of benefits and restrictions.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

The program's goals were to create a course list, sort it, and display any prerequisites linked to each course. I was aware of these goals from the start. Since a binary search tree is renowned for its quick sorting skills, I chose it as the data structure. However, alternative strategies may have been employed as well because the course list was not too long.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I rely on going back to lesson on ZY book or online tools like Google and Stack Overflow in order to get through the majority of the obstacles in my project. Reading files was one of my biggest problems, and it took me a while to find solid solutions. I developed my own version of CSV parser and utilize in the course to read files, I ran across a number of problems while making it, forcing me to spend a lot of time in editing until it finally work.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I've learned by working on this project that there are different ways to make programs, and some of them work better than others. The development of algorithms that effectively function with a program requires a good grasp of its requirements and goals; otherwise, the code may not operate as expected and may be slower than desired.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

By arranging your programs in an aesthetically pleasing style, it appears that you have taken effort to make them maintainable and understandable. Regarding flexibility, it's wonderful to know that you have discovered several techniques for developing algorithms that can adjust to diverse applications. You will surely benefit from this newly acquired information in the future as you develop programs that are more flexible and effective.
